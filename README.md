# Feature of my Projects are
- This is online market place based project

- All 6 routes are private including home page
- Here all login user will see all categories of jobs and they can bid it.
- But who post the job can't bid his/her job and bid post will accept or reject only who post that job.
- I also included some motion animated to set the site more nice to see the users.
